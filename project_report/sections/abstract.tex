In this document we present Cloud4Things, a solution that proposes to make the deploy and manage IoT applications for smart places.
Due to the heterogeneity of IoT applications, management tasks such as application deployment and management are complex tasks
that require advanced technical knowledge. Cloud4Things proposes to decrease the complexity of these tasks by adopting a high-level perspective
enables to perform the deployment and management operations of IoT applications.
To simplify the deployment operation at the Cloud, Cloud4Things will rely on cloud orchestrators tools to execute such task.
These orchestration tools allow the specification of the application structure in high-level abstraction and allow the control the life-cycle of the application.
Cloud4Things will allow the management of the provisioned resources at the Cloud by a smart place only having in mind
the business rules of this particular space. With Cloud4Things, smart places managers will be able to monitor the performance of its
smart place in real time. This document also presents the state-of-the-art solution as well an overview about the proposed approaches and
evaluation methods.
