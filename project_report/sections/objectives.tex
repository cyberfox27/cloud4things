\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:Objectives}
As pointed out by Waizennegger et. al \cite{waizenegger2013policy4tosca}, TOSCA allows to specify policies that express non-functional requirements,
like cost, security, and environmental issues. But TOSCA lacks a detailed description of how to apply, design and implement these policies.
Thus the objective of this work is extend the OpenTOSCA ecosystem to make possible express business policies in order to define the business rules
that are required by the IoT applications in a given context. More specifically, through the Vinotek Self-Service Portal the functional and
non-functional requirements can be defined by tranlating a business policie from a more abstract level to a more specific level, for example, if a store
has a flow of 500 clients per day, that can be translated that the IoT application requires a certain minimum value of network-bandwith and memory storage.
