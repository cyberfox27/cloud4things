\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The Internet of Things is a paradigm that will revolutionize the way in that common objects interact with the environment
In this document we introduce the concept of Internet of Things in the scope of smart places. A smart place is an ecosystem
that is composed by smart objects, in this case RIFD tagged objects, that are interconnected within the Internet infrastructure present in this smart place.
However, due to the diversity of smart objects and its different communication protocols, these smart places are characterized
for its heterogeneity which increases the complexity the execution of management tasks such as deployment and monitoring of the
IoT application that is running in this smart place. Actually the state or art solution reduces the complexity of such tasks by
automating the deployment process, but as mentioned in \ref{sec:objectives} this solution requires an high level of expertise in
order to perform this tasks.\\

Therefore, with this work we pretend to decrease the complexity of the execution of these management tasks in two ways. First,
we pretend to automate the deployment of IoT applications in smart places by using Cloud orchestration tools, these tools will also
allow to describe the application structure in a high-level perspective, thus modelling the applications structure only requires
to have in mind the application logic. In the other hand, the main objective of this work is to enable the business owners to define
the Service Level Agreements (SLA) only having in mind the business rules of its smart place. With this approach the business owner will
be able to monitoring the performance of its smart place and establish the amount of resources needed by the application in order to
have an adequate \textit{QoS}.\\

In the evaluation of the developed solution, we will evaluate the perfomance of the application regarding the amount of data that is generated by
the objects that are in the smart place. An important point of the evaluation is to demonstrate the possible scenarios where the smart
place generates more data then the Cloud can process and the opposite scenario where the Cloud is overpowered. Ultimately,
we pretend that this work contributes to improve the developed work in the field of smart places, focusing in a area that is essential to guarantee the correct
operation of them, \textit{QoS} support.
