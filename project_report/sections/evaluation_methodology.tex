\section{Evaluation Methodology}
\label{sec:evaluation}
To evaluate the solution the approach consists in evaluate the performance of the Cloud and also the correctness of
the received RFID events.\\

RFID has its particular characteristics, which makes that traditional event processing systems cannot support them. Furthermore, RFID
events are temporal constrained \cite{wang2006bridging}. Temporal constraints as the time interval between two events and the time interval
for a single event are critical to event detection. In order to assure the correctness of these received events, some conditions must be defined
regarding the time interval that between the events.\\

Another aspect that is important concerns with the performance of Cloud regarding the amount of data generated by the events. Cloud computing creates an illusion that
available computing resources on demand are infinite \cite{armbrust2009m}. However, with the increase of the amount of events, we must measuring these computing resoruces
in order to determine if the system fulfilling the \textit{QoS} requirements. To achieve that, some metrics such as CPU utilization, I/O throughput,
memory RAM consumption and memory storage must be measured and compared with the defined SLA's in order to decide if the system is overloaded or not.
