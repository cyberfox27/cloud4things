In this document we present Cloud4Things, a solution that proposes to make the deployment
and management of IoT applications for smart places. Due to the heterogeneity of IoT applications,
management tasks such as deployment are complex tasks that require advanced technical knowledge.
Cloud4Things proposes to decrease the complexity of these tasks by adopting a high-level perspective
to perform the deployment and management operations of IoT applications. To simplify the
deployment operation at the Cloud, Cloud4Things will rely on cloud orchestration tools to execute such task.
That allow the specification of the application structure and allow the control
the life-cycle of the application. Cloud4Things will allow the management and monitoring of the
provisioned resources at the Cloud by a smart place in a high abstraction perspective.
This document also presents the state-of-the-art solution as well an overview about the
proposed approaches and evaluation methods.
