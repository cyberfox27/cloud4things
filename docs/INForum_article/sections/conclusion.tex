\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we propose Cloud4Things, a solution to automate the provisioning of the smart places
infrastructure in the cloud. Our solution relies on configuration management tools to automate the
provisioning the RFID software in the cloud providers. In the current approach, we decide to use
Docker containers to provisioning the software stack due to the performance benefits that this
technology offers. Our current prototype already is capable to support the stages of a smart place
application. For the future work we want to collect some metrics to compare the performance of our solution
with the other solutions. For that, we will measure the elasticity of the application regarding the
events that occur in the physical world. Currently, our solution is centralized, i.e, all the container
that runs the Fosstrak application are located in the same machine, a important component of our
work will be to compare the current approach with a distributed solution.
