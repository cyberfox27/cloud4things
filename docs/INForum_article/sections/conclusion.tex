\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this section we will present the conclusion of the paper and also we will discuss about some
enhancements of our work.

At the top of the Future Work list is the measure of the elasticity of the application regarding
the events that occur in the physical world. Currently our solution is centralized, i.e, all the
container that runs the Fosstrak application are located in the same machine, a important component
of our work is to compare the current approach with a distributed solution. Finally, the client
application still is textual, in the future a important feature that can be added to our solution
is a GUI that allows the user to have a more visual perspective of the configuration of the smart
place.
