\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we propose Cloud4Things, a solution to automate the provisioning of the smart places
infrastructure in the cloud. Our solution relies on configuration management tools to automate the
provisioning the RFID software in the cloud providers. In the current approach, we decide to use
Docker containers to provisioning the software stack due to the performance benefits that this
technology offers. Our current prototype already is capable of automating some of the most important
life-cycle stages of a smart place. Currently, our solution is centralized, i.e, all the containers that run
the Fosstrak application are located in the same machine, a important component of our work will be to
compare the current approach with a distributed solution. For the future work we want to collect some
metrics to further compare the performance of our solution with the other solutions. For that, we will measure
the scalability of the application regarding the quantity of events that occur in the physical world. Another aspect
that is important is to verify if the latency of the events processing is acceptable.
