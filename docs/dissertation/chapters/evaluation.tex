%A possible scenario is where a product is being transported from the warehouse inventory section to
%the processing section and there is a door that separates the two sections. When the reader that is
%close to the door detects that a product is approaching the door, an event is triggered and the
%application middleware is responsible to process this event and take the correct decision, in this
%case it must open the warehouse door. In that case we need to determine if a cloud-based solution
%can met the latency interaction requirements for that smart place, otherwise if these requirements are
%not met, a possible situation is where the automated vehicle crashes with door because the request latency
%was to high and then the door took longer to open than expected.\\
