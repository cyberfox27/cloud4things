\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:introduction}
In recent years, computing is becoming more ubiquitous in the physical world. The term \gls{ubicomp}
was introduced many years ago by Mark Weiser \cite{weiser1991computer}. In this vision computational elements
are embedded seamlessly in ordinary objects that are connected through a continuously available network.
Technology advances such as the mobile Internet contributes to achieve this vision \cite{gubbi2013internet},
as well as the \gls{IoT}, a system composed of physical items that are continuously connected
to the virtual world and can act as physical access points to Internet Services \cite{mattern2010internet}.
However, there are some challenges that must be addressed in order to make these \gls{ubicomp} systems truly
ubiquitous \cite{caceres2012ubicomp} such as data, context awareness and infrastructure. An important
concern regards ubiquitous data: \textit{Where it is located?}, \textit{Who can access it?} and
\textit{How much time should this data persist?} Also, ubiquitous systems are constantly interacting
with the surrounding environment. Thus, these systems need to understand the context in which they are
inserted and also to adapt to the changes that occur in this environment. Another import concern regards
about the infrastructure burden of the ubiquitous systems. Many times these systems requires low-latency
interaction with users and environments, which implies that at least part of an \gls{ubicomp} system
needs to be tightly bound to the local infrastructure of the interacting environment. This requirement
for local infrastructure can be a barrier in the adoption of ubiquitous systems in a large-scale
perspective. The \gls{IoT} and the Utility Computing in the cloud paradigms can help to solve those
issues.\\

On one hand, the Utility Computing in the cloud provides the illusion of infinite computing resources
available on demand to the public users \cite{armbrust2010view}. This paradigm can help to reduce the
infrastructure burden of ubiquitous systems, while providing important features such as high availability
and high scalability. The Utility computing provides data centralization, allowing users
to store data during long periods of time and to define the access policies for this data.
%
On the other hand, the \gls{IoT} aims to solve a key problem in wider adoption of ubiquitous systems,
the tight coupling with a particular embedded infrastructure. With the \gls{IoT} a variety of
\textit{objects} or \textit{things} - such as \gls{RFID} tags, sensors, actuators, etc. - will be
able to interact with each other and cooperate with the surrounding \textit{things} to reach common
goals \cite{atzori2010internet}. Furthermore, \gls{IoT} middleware solutions are able to processing
the raw data collected from these \textit{things} in order to understand the context where they
are inserted.\\

% Application Domains
\section{Application Domains}
\label{sec:application_domains}
The Internet of Things offers a great potential that makes possible the development of a huge number
of applications. There are several environments and domains where \gls{IoT} applications are expected
to improve the quality of life of the people that live and work in these environments and also
will provide competitive advantage against current solutions. Currently, some of the application
domains that promise to play a big role in the adoption of \gls{IoT} are:

% Smart Environments
\subparagraph{Ambient Intelligence.} Environments that use the intelligence of the objects within
themselves to become a more comfortable and efficient environment. For instance, a room that has its
temperature adapted according to the weather, an office that has its lights adapted according the time
of the day and an automated industrial plant where its is possible to monitor the production progress.
% Logistics
\subparagraph{Logistics.} Real-time information processing based on technologies such as \gls{RFID}
allow the monitoring of almost every phase of the supply chain, ranging from raw material
purchasing, transportation, storage, distribution and after-sales services.
% Transportation
\subparagraph{Transportation.} From personal vehicles to public transportation, mobile ticketing
and transportation of goods. Cars, trains and buses are equipped with sensors, actuators and computational
power that are able to provide information about the status of the vehicle, improve the navigation and
even perform collision avoidance. Regarding the transportation of goods, it is possible to monitor
the conservation status of perishable goods - temperature, humidity, etc. -  during its transportation.
% Healthcare
\subparagraph{Healthcare} \gls{RFID} tags can be used to monitor the position of patients,
hospital staff and also to control the inventory of materials. Sensors can be used to monitor
patient conditions, hospital environment conditions - temperature, air quality, etc.\\

Beyond the presented examples, the \gls{IoT} field covers many other domains. To give a more unified
view over those domains, we propose the term \textit{smart places}, that can be defined as a system
composed of sensors - e.g. RFID - actuators - e.g. automatic doors - and computational infrastructure
- e.g. servers - that are able to acquire data about the surrounding environment and use that data to
improve the experience of the people interacting with the place.

% Smart Places Challenges
\section{Smart Places Challenges}
\label{section:challenges}
Challenges \cite{caceres2012ubicomp} for the construction of smart places that resulted from leveraging
part of the smart place infrastructure to the cloud:\\

% Challenges
\begin{itemize}
  % Data
  \item \textbf{Data} is continuously generated by the \textit{things} that compose the system.
  These data must be stored, processed and presented in a seamless and efficient way. Several
  middleware solutions for smart places \cite{floerkemeier2007rfid}\cite{eisenhauer2010hydra}\cite{de2008socrades}
  relies on database management systems that are very efficient, but will those systems able to
  handle with the volume of data generated by smart place applications?
  % Deployment
  \item \textbf{Deployment} of smart places usually is performed in an isolated and vertical manner
  where hardware, middleware and application logics are tightly coupled. This provisioning model presents
  some limitations that makes the deployment of a smart place an inefficient process, since that each
  time that a smart place is deployed its software components and embedded devices need to be manually
  installed and configured. Therefore, new provisioning approaches need to be adopted in order to make
  the deployment of smart places more efficient and scalable.
  % Low-latency Interaction
  \item \textbf{Low-latency Interaction} is a key requirement that requires that both network access
  latency and data transmission latency be reduced. However, in a cloud-based deployment, part of the
  system's infrastructure is moved to the cloud - for instance the middleware layer, which is responsible
  for processing the information and take decisions based on the results. However, will a cloud-based
  deployment able to meet the low-latency requirements of many smart place systems?
  % Management
  \item \textbf{Management} of smart places is an issue that must be carefully addressed. It has been
  shown that end-users are unable to manage their own personal computers systems well \cite{doll1988measurement}
  and there is no reason to believe that they will had a better performance at managing a much more
  complex system. It is reasonable to assume that service providers will perform the management of
  the services . These managed services introduces new questions that must be answered. For instance,
  who will pay for this services and who will control this services?
  % Cost
  \item \textbf{Cost vs. Performance} of smart placeas infrastructure - i.e. hardware, software,
  maintenance and energy costs - is an important issue that can determine if the cloud platform is the most
  adequate to support smart place instead of a local infrastructure. By leveraging the smart
  place infrastructure to the cloud the cost of its infrastructure can be reduced in a significant
  amount. However, will be the performance of the smart place satisfactory when its infrastructure is
  leveraged to the cloud?
\end{itemize}

% Objectives
\section{Objectives}
\label{section:objectives}
The objective of this work is to determine if the cloud platform is able fulfill the fundamental
requirements of smart places. In this work we focused to determining if a cloud-based
deployment can meet the low-latency interaction and data storage performance requirements. Since
smart places presents different requirements according its domain, our efforts will be engaged in
determine if the cloud platform is suitable to support a smart warehouse that relies on the RFID
technology \cite{want2006introduction}.\\

\subsection{Example Domain}
\label{sub:domain}
Our smart place example domain is an automated warehouse. In the warehouse, products are transported
through automated guided vehicles. These products are tagged with \gls{RFID} tags that can be identified
by \gls{RFID} readers.  Through the data collected by these readers is possible to gather information
about the smart place. For instance, is possible to determine which products enter or leave the
warehouse. A complete example of a platform that allows the transformation of that data into
information is Fosstrak\footnote{\url{http://fosstrak.github.io/}}, an open source \gls{RFID}
software that implements the \gls{EPC} Network standards.\\

To accomplish our objectives, in this work we will follow two approaches and determine which of them
is more adequate to deploy a smart warehouse based on the \gls{RFID} technology. . The first, is a
more traditional deployment approach, where all the application middleware is provisioned in the cloud.
The second is a deployment approach based on the Fog Computing\cite{bonomi2012fog} paradigm,
a virtualized platform that is located close to the smart place and provides network, computing
and storage resources between the embedded devices in the physical place and the traditional cloud.\\

Since the cloud platform offers flexibility to deploy applications, we propose a solution that
automates the deployment of \gls{RFID} application middleware in the cloud regarding the chosen approach:
cloud or fog. Our solution consists in a provisioning mechanism that automates the application
deployment according pre-defined provisioning policies and software images.\\

Our initial hypothesis is that a fog-based deployment will present a best overall performance and as
consequence will be more adequate to deploy the smart warehouse \gls{RFID} application middleware.
However the data storage capabilities of fog are inferior and they will have to be
validated whether they are enough.
