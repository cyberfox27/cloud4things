\section{Related Work}
\label{section:related_work}
Recently a lot of research and effort has been dedicated to solve these existing problems. In this
section we will present a summary of the most relevant work that address to solve the problems of
converging the Internet of Things and the utility computing:

% Infrastructure Provisioning
\subsection{Infrastructure Provisioning}
\label{sub:provisioning}
The research area for infrastructure provisioning of IoT solutions is the one that presents the most
notable progress until now.

% Soldatos
\subparagraph{Soldatos} et al. \cite{soldatos2012convergence} presented the idea of converging the IoT
and the utility computing in the cloud. The proposed architecture is the core concept of the OpenIoT
Project\footnote{http://openiot.eu}, and is based on CoAP \cite{shelby2014constrained} and linked data.
The cloud is used at infrastructure level, which allows to measure the utility of the services provided
by inter-connected objects.
% Distefano
\subparagraph{Distefano} et al. \cite{distefano2012enabling} proposed a conceptual architecture by mapping various
elements in both clouds and IoT to the three layers of cloud architecture (\gls{PaaS}, \gls{SaaS} and \gls{IaaS}).
In this proposal IoT resources are provided voluntarily by their owners, while management functions
- such as node management and policy enforcement - are viewed as peer functions of cloud infrastructure
management. IoT resources and cloud infrastructure are mashed up for applications, which are delivered
through \gls{SaaS}.
% CloudThings
\subparagraph{CloudThings} \cite{zhou2013cloudthings} is an architecture that uses a common
approach to integrate Internet of Things and Cloud Computing. The proposed architecture is an online
platform which accommodates \gls{IaaS}, \gls{PaaS}, \gls{SaaS} and allows system integrators and
solution providers to leverage the complete application infrastructure for developing, operating
and composing applications and services.
% IoT PaaS
\subparagraph{Li} et. al \cite{li2013efficient} proposed IoT PaaS, a cloud platform that supports
scalable IoT service delivery. Solution providers are able to deliver new solutions by leveraging
computing resources and platform services - domain mediation, application context management, etc.
- on the cloud. The proposed architecture aims to enable virtual vertical service delivery, for that
it has a multi-tenant nature which is designed to help at the isolation of the environments of
different solutions.

% Scalable Data Storage
\subsection{Scalable Data Storage}
\label{sub:data_storage}
Since that no general solution for scalable data storage and retrieval in the cloud was developed,
cloud providers started to implement its own solutions.

\subparagraph{Google Big Table, Facebook Cassandra and  Amazon Dynamo} \cite{chang2008bigtable} \cite{lakshman2010cassandra}
\cite{decandia2007dynamo} are key-value stores - \gls{NoSQL} databases - that has the ability to horizontally scale - i.e,
distribute both data and load of simple operations through many servers - but it has a weaker concurrency model
than the ACID transactions of most \glspl{RDBMS} systems \cite{cattell2011scalable}.

\subparagraph{\gls{PIQL}} \cite{armbrust2010piql} is a SQL-like API built to run on top of existing
performance predictable key-value stores, that provides many of the benefits of using a traditional
\gls{RDBMS}, such as the ability to express the queries in a declarative way, automatic data
parallelism, physical data independence and automatic index selection and maintenance, all while
maintaining the soft real-time guarantees on application performance that come from the underlying
key-value store.\\

Recently, some progress has been reached as regards scalable storage for \gls{RDBMS} systems. Although
most of the work still are in development, it is possible to highlight some solutions that are in a more
mature state.

\subparagraph{MySQL Cluster} \cite{ronstrom2004mysql} is an in-memory clustered distributed \gls{RDBMS}. Compared with
the MySQL implementation it works by replacing the InnoDB engine with the NDB - a proprietary
distributed layer from MySQL. MySQL Cluster is built on top of a shared-nothing architecture and includes
features such as failover, node recovery, synchronous data replication and no single point of failure.
MySQL Cluster seem to be the solution that scales to more nodes than other \gls{RDBMS} - 48 is the limit.
However, it was reported that after scaling up to a few dozen nodes it starts to running into
bottlenecks \cite{bunch2010evaluation}.

\subparagraph{VoltDB} \cite{stonebraker2013voltdb} is a \gls{RDBMS} designed for performance and scalability. VoltDB
assumes a multi-node cluster architecture where the tables are partitioned over multiple servers. Tables
can be replicated over servers - e.g. for fast access to data - shards are always replicated -
to recovery the data in case of a node crash - and database snapshots are supported. Currently some
features still are missing - online schema changes are limited and asynchronous \gls{WAN} replication and
recovery are not yet implemented - but in its current implementation VoltDB already presents some
features that improves the performance of SQL execution, as result the number of nodes that are needed
to support a given application load can be reduced in a significant way.

% Low-latency Interaction
\subsection{Low-latency Interaction}
\label{sub:low_latency_interaction}
Finding a general solution for the low-latency requirement of \gls{IoT} systems is not a easy task.
Since there are several application domains, is natural that each application domain requires
that different values for network latency and data transmission latency are guaranteed.
